# Terminal-Chess
An implementation of Chess playable via the terminal (February 2020).

This is a terminal implementation of chess via python done as part of a challenge homework assignment from what seems like eons ago. As an exercise, I intend on improving on the features/bugs throughout the summer of 2021 :)
